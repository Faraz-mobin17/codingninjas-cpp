Step 1. Create a new Node Temp and allocate memory to it.
Step2: [Check for memory overflow]
        Check if temp = NULL
        Print "Overflow" and Exit
Step 3: Enter ITEM value to insert
Step 4: Set temp -> info = ITEM
Step 5: [Check if start = NULL]
Step 6: IF step 5 is true then
        set temp -> prev = NULL
        set temp -> next = NULL
STEP 7: IF step 5 is False then
        set temp -> prev = NULL
        set temp -> next = start
        Assign addresss of temp to the prev pointer of first node of exisiting list so
        Set start -> prev = temp
STEP 8: [UPDATE START NODE]
            start = temp
END

CIRCULAR LINKED list
Step 1: [create a new node]
    temp = new Node(data)
Step 2: [check for overflow condition]
        check if temp = NULL
        print "overflow"
        exit
STEP 3: temp -> info = ITEM
STEP 4: [check if list is empty and new node inserted is first node]
        check if (first == NULL)
        first = temp
        first -> next = first

STEP 5: check else condition
